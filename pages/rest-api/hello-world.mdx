# Hello World API

To get started with your first API, you can either copy this or write this on your own to understand steps.

This example explains how to setup a basic endpoint and send simple text in return on every request.

#### Points to note
- The endpoint made is a GET Request which you learnt in [Types of HTTP Requests](/introduction/requests)
- We're only sending simple text without any formatting or a json object in this API


#### How to setup your node app

1. Open a terminal/Command prompt window in your project folder. If you're using VSCode just press ` CTRL + ~ `
2. Run `npm init` and setup the required fields to setup your package.json.
3. Replace `"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"` with `"start":"node index.js"` to setup your start script
4. Run `npm install express` to install express in your node modules.
5. Make a file named `index.js` and paste the following code into it or write you own it you want to!

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

6. Run `npm start` in your terminal.
7. Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view your first endpoint
